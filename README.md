# Borb CAM Slicer
Borb CAM Slicer is a CNC toolpath generator built for makers, engineers, and artists who need real multi-axis control. It converts 3D OBJ models into clean, efficient G-code for machines ranging from simple 3-axis mills to full 6-axis CNC setups. Instead of just stacking flat slices, Borb CAM interprets triangular mesh geometry to create surface-following toolpaths that hug curves, slopes, and deep cuts â€” perfect for complex and organic shapes. It supports dynamic tool and machine setups, adaptive step control, and advanced multi-axis motion planning. Whether you're carving sculptures, machining parts, or building molds, Borb CAM gives you the flexibility to go from raw 3D geometry to a finished piece with fewer compromises, fewer crashes, and a lot more control.
